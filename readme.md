📊 Job Market Analysis and CV Matching Script 📄

This Python script is designed to perform job market analysis and match a user's CV with job listings. It uses data from the Wuzzuf job platform, a popular job search website.

🚀 Purpose of the Model
The purpose of this script is to provide insights into the job market, including the most in-demand job titles, industries with the highest demand, geographic distribution of job opportunities, and to match a user's CV with job listings based on keywords and skills.

🔧 Required Libraries
This script uses the following Python libraries:

requests: To make HTTP requests to the Wuzzuf API.
json: To handle JSON data for storing and processing job-related information.
PyPDF2: To extract text from PDF files (used for CV analysis).
Counter from the collections module: To count occurrences of items (used for data analysis).
matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization, particularly to create bar charts.
pandas: To create and manipulate data frames for data analysis.
WordCloud: To generate word clouds for textual data visualization.
🏃‍♀️ How to Run the Code
Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries.
Set up a virtual environment if necessary to manage dependencies.
Download the provided code script and place it in a directory.
Ensure you have an internet connection to access the Wuzzuf job platform data.
Replace the cv_pdf_path variable with the path to your CV PDF file (if you want to use your CV for matching).
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script by executing the command: python script_name.py. Replace script_name.py with the actual script filename.
📜 Code Description
Process 1: Fetching Job Listings and Company Details 🌐
The script starts by making requests to the Wuzzuf API to fetch job listings based on a specified job title (e.g., "Data Analyst"). It retrieves job details and company information.

Process 2: Data Structuring and Consolidation 📑
The job and company details are consolidated into a structured format and saved as JSON data in a file named consolidated_jobs.json. This structured data is used for subsequent analysis and matching.

Process 3: Data Analysis 📈
Subprocess 3a: Most Common Job Titles 📋
The script analyzes the job titles from the consolidated data and identifies the top 10 most common job titles. It creates a bar chart to visualize the results and saves them in a JSON file named most_common_job_titles.json.

Subprocess 3b: Industries or Sectors with the Highest Demand 💼
It analyzes the industries or sectors from the consolidated data and identifies the top 10 with the highest demand. This data is visualized using a bar chart and saved in a JSON file named most_common_industries.json.

Subprocess 3c: Geographic Distribution of Job Opportunities 🌍
The script analyzes job locations from the consolidated data and identifies the top 10 locations with the highest number of job opportunities. Geographic distribution data is saved in a JSON file named geographic_distribution.json.

Process 4: CV Matching 📝
The script reads a user's CV from a PDF file, extracts text from it, tokenizes the text into keywords, and calculates suitability scores for each job listing based on keyword matches. It saves the matching results in a JSON file named job_scores.json and displays the top 10 matching job listings along with their scores.

Process 5: Data Visualization 📊
Subprocess 5a: Bar Charts for Most In-Demand Job Titles 📊
A bar chart is created to visualize the top 10 most in-demand job titles.

Subprocess 5b: Word Clouds for Qualifications and Skills ☁️
A word cloud is generated to visualize frequently mentioned qualifications and skills in job listings.

Subprocess 5c: Geographic Heat Map (Additional Data Required) 🗺️
To create a geographic heat map illustrating job distribution, additional geographic data and libraries like Folium or Plotly are needed.

Subprocess 5d: Scatterplot or Bar Chart for Job Suitability Scores 📊
A scatterplot or bar chart is created to display job suitability scores for the user's CV.

📄 Output Files
most_common_job_titles.json: Contains data on the most common job titles.
most_common_industries.json: Contains data on industries with the highest demand.
geographic_distribution.json: Contains data on the geographic distribution of job opportunities.
job_scores.json: Contains matching scores for job listings based on the user's CV.
📝 Additional Notes
The script allows for customization and further analysis based on specific job titles and data requirements.
Geographic data visualization requires additional data and libraries beyond what's included in this script.
